Follow along with the whole tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c Be sure to watch the entire video. (It will help you with the quiz and the website he builds at the end builds on the concepts demonstrated in the first part of the video.) At time index 1:10:30, the presenter starts with HTML and CSS files so he can focus on the JavaScript. I've included those files in the repository for you. Create the main.js file he demonstrates. Copy the website he creates and activate GitHub Pages so it works on your GitHub account. Turn in the link to your GitHub account with your working website.
